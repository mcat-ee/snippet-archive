# Torify Python Sockets

This script will route traffic created using python sockets through the Tor SOCKS proxy.

Use:

```
	import torify
	# That's it!
```

This code transparently replaces a low level Python function for creating sockets.

If you'd like to use normal sockets at the same time as these SOCKS-encapsulated ones, use:

```
	import socket as old_homestyle_socket	#Import the library as a different symbol! (
	import torify				#Import the modified module in place of the normal one

	normal_socket = old_homestyle_socket()		#Normal socket object
	new_SOCKS_socket = socket()			#SOCKS-secured socket object
```
